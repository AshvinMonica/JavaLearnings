Design patterns
					 
• Design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
• programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems. 
• That means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.
• We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).
• Christopher Alexander was the first person who invented all the above Design Patterns in 1977.
• But later the Gang of Four - Design patterns, elements of reusable object-oriented software book was written by a group of four persons named as Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides in 1995.
• That's why all the above 23 Design Patterns are known as Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns.

Basically, design patterns are categorized into two parts:
1.	Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
2.	JEE Design Patterns.


Core Java Design Patterns
===============================

1.Creational design patterns
************************************
	• Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects.
	• These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

		1.	Factory Pattern
		2.	Abstract Factory Pattern
		3.	Singleton Pattern
		4.	Prototype Pattern
		5.	Builder Pattern

2.Structural Design Pattern
************************************
	• Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
	• The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.
	• These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.
	 
	 	1.	Adapter Pattern
		2.	Bridge Pattern
		3.	Composite Pattern
		4.	Decorator Pattern
		5.	Facade Pattern
		6.	Flyweight Pattern
		7.	Proxy Pattern

3.	Behavioral Design Pattern		
************************************		
	• Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
	• In these design patterns,the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
	
		1.	Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
		2.	Command Pattern
		3.	Interpreter Pattern
		4.	Iterator Pattern
		5.	Mediator Pattern
		6.	Memento Pattern
		7.	Observer Pattern
		8.	State Pattern
		9.	Strategy Pattern
		10.	Template Pattern
		11.	Visitor Pattern
		
JEE or J2EE Design Patterns
================================
		1. Presentation Layer Design Pattern
			1.	Intercepting Filter Pattern
			2.	Front Controller Pattern
			3.	View Helper Pattern
			4.	Composite View Pattern
		2. Business Layer Design Pattern
			1.	Business Delegate Pattern
			2.	Service Locator Pattern
			3.	Session Facade Pattern
			4.	Transfer Object Pattern
		3. Integration Layer Design Pattern
			1.	Data Access Object Pattern
			2.	Web Service Broker Pattern
